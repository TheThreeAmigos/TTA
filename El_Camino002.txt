*A collective document for the five amigos

*A place to upload and structure our shared thoughts (asychronously)

*Mi dubas, do mi pensas, do mi estas


All previous thoughts have been added to github

Some thoughts (and some testing of the export function)

I thought we could use this place as a live (and asynchronous) sounding board.

Instead of this perhaps we could vim and tmux over ssh ... or mosh?

Something that is both live and asynchronous ... and creates a document.

We really should be using markdown here

I wish this would output in MarkDown. Is there another solution.

Problem with padlet is that we cant export it as a final webpage or markdown file

<<<testing>>>

*A list

	* water
	* land
	* air

*A thought ...

What do you think?

OK, how about we look at learning python ... the 42 way(no teachers) ... using all the learning tech that is freely available to us? In the process we produce a resource that can be used by others plus we learn something about what it is to do true collabortive e-learning ... the three amigo way.

Here are some constarints (to make it more exciting) ...

Vim and/or Atom
Tmux
Mosh
Markdown
git and gitHub

OK so where do we start?

I think we already have.
